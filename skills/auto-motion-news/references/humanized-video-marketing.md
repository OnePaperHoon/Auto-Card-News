# Humanized Video Marketing

Use this reference before script approval and again before final MP4 render. It brings three outside inspirations into the short-form workflow without requiring the viewer to know them:

- Marketing Skills: audience, hook, social-content, ad-creative, and CTA checks inspired by `https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills`.
- Humanizer: remove AI-sounding phrasing and stiff script rhythm inspired by `https://github.com/blader/humanizer`.
- Claude Ads: campaign and paid-ad thinking for product promotion, especially PitchCheck, inspired by `https://github.com/AgriciDaniel/claude-ads`.

## Spoken Humanizer Pass

Read the script out loud before scene approval. If a line sounds like a press release, rewrite it.

Replace:

- "This innovation improves creative workflows"
- "Users can leverage advanced capabilities"
- "The platform enables productivity gains"
- "In today's rapidly changing AI landscape"
- literal translations or internal phrases that Korean viewers would not say out loud

With:

- "The annoying part is switching apps every 3 minutes."
- "This matters because the tool starts helping where you already work."
- "The win is not fancy. It is fewer repeat clicks."
- "If your team uses this, check the version first."
- "바로 코딩하지 말고 먼저 순서를 잡아줘요."
- "커밋 한 줄 때문에 토큰 폭탄 맞았다고?"
- "GitHub에서 별 제일 많은 레포가 뭘까?"

Each scene should sound like one person talking to one viewer. Short-form scripts should not read like caption paragraphs.

## Korean Persona Video QA

When the hook, narration, overlay, or caption still sounds like translated source text, run Korean Persona Video QA before motion work.

Use `references/korean-persona-video-qa.md` and sample real rows from `nvidia/Nemotron-Personas-Korea` with:

```powershell
python skills\auto-motion-news\scripts\sample_korean_personas.py --count 7 --topic "<topic>"
```

Use the sampled personas as a synthetic Korean viewer panel. The panel should catch:

- first 2-second hooks that only developers or AI insiders understand;
- spoken lines that sound like product documentation;
- overlay phrases that are too abstract to read quickly;
- scenes with no visual reason to keep watching;
- captions that are useful but too long for social viewing.

Keep the final script short, spoken, and source-backed.

## Retention Marketing Check

Before motion work, each scene needs a reason to keep watching:

- Scene 1: stop in the first 2 seconds with a viewer problem, shock, question, or visual proof.
- Scene 2: explain what this is in one plain sentence.
- Middle scenes: alternate proof, example, and consequence. Do not stack abstract explanation.
- Final scene: give one action the viewer can take now.

Strong first-scene inputs include concrete social proof: GitHub stars, leaderboard rank, public view count, official release date, benchmark result, or a surprising screenshot. If a metric is changing, keep the narration flexible and record the capture date in source notes.

For every scene, write:

- Why this scene exists
- What changes visually
- What the viewer learns or feels
- Why the next scene is worth watching

If two consecutive scenes only explain, merge or replace one with demo, zoom, typing, checklist, before/after, or visual proof.

## Ad / Conversion Mode

Use this mode for product promos, app marketing, lead magnets, or paid-ad style video. It is especially useful for PitchCheck.

Define:

- Audience: who should feel "this is for me"
- Problem: what they already deal with
- Offer: what the product or resource gives them
- Proof: UI demo, real workflow, review, metric, or source
- Objection: why they might ignore it
- CTA: comment keyword, link, install, save, or DM

Keep ad-style content honest. Do not promise results the source does not support. For app promotion, show the actual app moment as early as possible.

## Caption And Source Links

Captions should be shorter than the video script unless the user requests a long reference note.

Use:

- `Contents Editor · <channel>` for the channel that curated or edited the post
- `Source · <original owner/source>` for the owner of the news, tool, repo, video, or paper
- Direct links for GitHub repos, official announcements, docs, demo pages, or app stores when useful

The viewer should be able to understand the post from the video, then use the caption to verify or try the source.
